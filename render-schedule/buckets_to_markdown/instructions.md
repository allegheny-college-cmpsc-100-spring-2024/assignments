# Buckets to Markdown

Your job is to take the `JSON` files in the `buckets` folder and create a single file called `buckets.md` which puts a table in the following format under appropriate headers. There should be a row in the table for each assignment:

```
## Heading (Current, Past, or Upcoming)

| Assignment Link	| Submit trinket by*	| Complete attempt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Assignment name ](link)| Blank OR Deadline + 7* | Deadline |

```

renders as...

## Heading (Current, Past, or Upcoming)

| Assignment Link       | Submit trinket by*     | Complete attempt |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| [Assignment name ](link) | Blank OR Deadline + 7* | Deadline         |

*Note, the center column should be deadline + 7 for problem sets and exercises. For other assignment categories, it should be blank.
