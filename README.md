Most exercises and problem sets have two deadlines: the submit-trinket deadline and the complete attempt deadline. You should submit a link to your working trinket by the first deadline, but you have until the second deadline to work on the assignment before your grade is final. 

**Once you have completed objectives on a Trinket, you should not keep editing it or you might lose your checks when the scheduled gator runs!** If you want to keep experimenting with a Trinket, you can make a copy of by clicking the "copy" button above the editor. Rename it in a way that isn't confusing.
